# HELM Integration (placeholder)

This crate will bridge the platform with [Stanford HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/).

- Provide an `EvalRunner` implementation that launches HELM runs via CLI or Python API.
- Translate HELM outputs into `EvalResult`, `MetricRecord`, and `SampleRecord`.
- Handle multi-modal and scenario-based evaluations in future phases.
